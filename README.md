#ALU-MIPS-with-TMR
The project was made as final project of the Digital System's discipline (INE5406). It is an Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU) with Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR). The idea of the project was to utilize components already developed and studied in class, and others, alongside with the redundancy concept, focusing on developing the ideia of TMR which can be used in several applications, such as in space technology.
